What is Meteor?

Node.js web framework built around a whole bunch of packages
Websockets
Livereload
Mongo DB (minimongo)
Templating (Handlebars.js)
"insecure"
"autopublish"
accounts-password
accounts-ui

partial page reloads based on updated attributes

Uses fibers extensively, so not typical js async callback style of doing things

/app
  /client  - sent to client
    /compatibility - files in here get global scope access (otherwise they are wrapped in a new function scope automatically)
  /public  - acts like rails public folder
  /private - only served through assets api (serverside files, like i18n)
  /server - serverside logic, Meteor.call definitions for example
  /lib    - shared code, first files that are loaded on app initialization
  /tests  - test

mkdir -p client/compatibility public private server lib test
